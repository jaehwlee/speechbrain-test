/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0000.wav,869804,he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0001.wav,264046,the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0002.wav,491244,in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0003.wav,554124,they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0004.wav,263084,there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0005.wav,331404,in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0006.wav,503244,the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0007.wav,244524,but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0008.wav,494604,we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0009.wav,379564,the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0010.wav,654764,but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0011.wav,668044,with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0012.wav,220524,many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0013.wav,338444,it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0014.wav,280844,the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0015.wav,250604,the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0016.wav,248364,but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0017.wav,251884,nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0018.wav,268204,but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0019.wav,388204,he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0020.wav,316204,and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0021.wav,505164,there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2961-960-0022.wav,237644,plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0000.wav,281804,the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0001.wav,556204,what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0002.wav,527244,whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0003.wav,102284,and what sort of evidence is logically possible
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0004.wav,449964,there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0005.wav,247084,all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0006.wav,240364,the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0007.wav,509004,habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0008.wav,115884,but i do not think such an inference is warranted
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0009.wav,541164,our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0010.wav,486124,we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0011.wav,200044,some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0012.wav,116524,familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0013.wav,465964,in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0014.wav,254124,i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0015.wav,257644,they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0016.wav,339244,in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0017.wav,253804,there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0018.wav,379084,there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0019.wav,580684,it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0020.wav,250764,if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0021.wav,209964,remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0022.wav,206124,some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0023.wav,200524,in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0024.wav,202924,the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0025.wav,697004,we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0026.wav,297644,this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0027.wav,356364,a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0028.wav,369964,i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0029.wav,273324,the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0030.wav,233004,semon's two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0031.wav,405324,they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0032.wav,124204,it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0033.wav,374124,it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0034.wav,464364,whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0035.wav,241804,thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0036.wav,103564,a further stage is recognition
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0037.wav,657164,recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0038.wav,719724,we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0039.wav,146924,this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0040.wav,534284,there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0041.wav,478284,the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0042.wav,600364,thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8230-279154-0043.wav,783564,of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0000.wav,462124,he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0001.wav,241964,in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0002.wav,109324,but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0003.wav,126604,your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0004.wav,77644,frankly i cannot always say
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0005.wav,175084,but suppose you said i'm fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0006.wav,249484,i've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps i'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0007.wav,104844,anyhow it's jolly exciting and i can do the dialogue all right
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0008.wav,141804,lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0009.wav,140204,and i should begin with a short homily on soliloquy
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0010.wav,69164,ham to be or not to be
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0011.wav,92364,now the object of this soliloquy is plain
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0012.wav,524844,indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlet's soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist's meaning
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/7176-92135-0013.wav,100844,we moderns however see the absurdity of it

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8455-210777-0043.wav,100684,but what is the delicate mission i asked

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8455-210777-0045.wav,361164,then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/8455-210777-0046.wav,298604,you may be quite sure it's there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2830-3980-0071.wav,126764,we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2830-3980-0072.wav,155404,this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2830-3980-0073.wav,529964,this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2830-3980-0074.wav,182444,this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0019.wav,474284,the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0020.wav,331244,it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0021.wav,350444,the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0022.wav,437324,meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0023.wav,353964,i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0024.wav,152684,but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0025.wav,489004,they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0026.wav,563084,the arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0027.wav,275884,edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0028.wav,830124,there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0029.wav,205644,hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0030.wav,319404,the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0031.wav,530764,associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0032.wav,374124,the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0033.wav,563404,in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0034.wav,275404,the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0035.wav,815724,in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0036.wav,226764,the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0037.wav,254924,he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0038.wav,179564,he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0039.wav,76364,the problem was solved
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0040.wav,174604,we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/2300-131720-0041.wav,120044,we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0000.wav,374284,kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers's visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0001.wav,298124,it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state's prison as a consequence of his rash act
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0002.wav,98444,i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0003.wav,134924,it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0004.wav,228684,but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0005.wav,215084,he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0006.wav,230284,if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0007.wav,123724,but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0008.wav,151724,fairview was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0009.wav,135084,they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0010.wav,100524,we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0011.wav,149964,i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0012.wav,137484,oh say that's different observed markham altering his demeanor
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0013.wav,87244,may we see gates at once asked kenneth
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0014.wav,117004,they followed the jailer along a succession of passages
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0015.wav,208844,sometimes i'm that yearning for a smoke i'm nearly crazy an i dunno which is worst dyin one way or another
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0016.wav,131884,he unlocked the door and called here's visitors tom
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0017.wav,113484,worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0018.wav,227564,miss de graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0019.wav,85324,sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0020.wav,164044,sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a bench here
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0021.wav,252684,a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0022.wav,131724,we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0023.wav,156524,i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0024.wav,158284,old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0025.wav,183564,then rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0026.wav,148524,he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0027.wav,98124,whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0028.wav,105324,he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0029.wav,65324,it's a stock company and rich
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0030.wav,157164,i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0031.wav,177804,as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved them a heavy loss one day
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0032.wav,183084,i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0033.wav,128684,it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0034.wav,193804,i'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0035.wav,88204,it won't be much but i'm grateful to find a friend
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0036.wav,177804,they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0037.wav,81004,i've seen lots of that kind in my day
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0038.wav,80204,and it ruins a man's disposition
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0039.wav,129484,he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0040.wav,152684,some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0043.wav,82924,and he deserves a term in state's prison
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0044.wav,103244,it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0045.wav,68364,i'll pay all the costs besides
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0046.wav,82284,you're foolish why should you do all this
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0047.wav,74444,i have my own reasons mister marshall
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0048.wav,207884,give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0049.wav,236844,he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0050.wav,93324,beth uneasy at his silence nudged him
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0051.wav,113484,there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0052.wav,147244,he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68769-0053.wav,203564,and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0000.wav,426124,so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forbes's aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0001.wav,331404,one of mister hopkins's first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0002.wav,286124,the weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0003.wav,128524,the democratic committee figured out a way to do this
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0004.wav,270124,under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0005.wav,197324,the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0006.wav,189484,and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0007.wav,521164,the description she gave of the coming reception to the woman's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0008.wav,229804,these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/6829-68771-0020.wav,147724,then she gave a little laugh and replied no miss beth i'm elizabeth parsons

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0003.wav,209644,without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0004.wav,144524,i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0005.wav,87884,i was absent rather more than an hour
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0006.wav,347244,the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant bannister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0007.wav,146124,the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0008.wav,137804,the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0009.wav,225324,the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0010.wav,170284,i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0011.wav,90444,a broken tip of lead was lying there also
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0012.wav,226124,not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0013.wav,138284,above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0014.wav,91404,to the best of my belief they were rolled up
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0015.wav,159564,did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0016.wav,136204,i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0017.wav,73004,so it seems to me
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0018.wav,85644,now mister soames at your disposal
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0019.wav,86604,above were three students one on each story
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0020.wav,164364,then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0021.wav,118924,there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0022.wav,105484,i am afraid there are no signs here said he
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0023.wav,106604,one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0024.wav,143404,you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0025.wav,125004,the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0026.wav,152844,as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0027.wav,167244,how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0028.wav,82764,then he tossed it down and seized the next
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0029.wav,321804,he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0030.wav,111404,mister soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0031.wav,200044,holmes held out a small chip with the letters n n and a space of clear wood after them you see
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0032.wav,132364,watson i have always done you an injustice there are others
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0033.wav,238444,i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0034.wav,223724,as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0035.wav,159404,holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa what's this
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0036.wav,127404,holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0037.wav,183404,what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0038.wav,241164,i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0039.wav,119244,and they are all in for this examination yes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0040.wav,120044,one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0041.wav,114444,let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0042.wav,187724,my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0043.wav,87724,the top floor belongs to miles mc laren
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0044.wav,176204,i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0045.wav,139564,he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0046.wav,113004,but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0047.wav,83404,did you look at these papers on the table
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0048.wav,89164,how came you to leave the key in the door
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0049.wav,123086,anyone in the room could get out yes sir
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0050.wav,98764,i really don't think he knew much about it mister holmes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0051.wav,63404,only for a minute or so
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0052.wav,110444,oh i would not venture to say sir
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141083-0053.wav,128524,you haven't seen any of them no sir
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0000.wav,147724,it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0001.wav,104524,he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0002.wav,189004,this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0003.wav,131244,no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrist's door
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0004.wav,288204,of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0005.wav,80524,that is very important said holmes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0006.wav,68364,you don't seem to realize the position
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0007.wav,64684,to morrow is the examination
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0008.wav,217484,i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0009.wav,149964,it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0010.wav,143084,i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0011.wav,160044,when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0012.wav,79564,the foul mouthed fellow at the top
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0013.wav,71244,he is the one with the worst record
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0014.wav,127084,why bannister the servant what's his game in the matter
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0015.wav,111084,he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0016.wav,190764,my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0017.wav,64044,no good my dear watson
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0018.wav,107084,i think so you have formed a conclusion
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0019.wav,100044,yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0020.wav,91564,look at that he held out his hand
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0021.wav,128364,on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0022.wav,65964,and one more this morning
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0023.wav,279564,in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0024.wav,293964,he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0025.wav,76044,you know him i think so
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0026.wav,223884,if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0027.wav,107564,no sir certainly not
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0028.wav,85004,there was no man sir
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0029.wav,258444,his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0030.wav,68684,just close the door said holmes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0031.wav,207084,we want to know mister gilchrist how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0032.wav,159884,for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0033.wav,224044,come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0034.wav,143724,well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you no injustice

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0036.wav,79244,the indian i also thought nothing of
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0037.wav,94924,when i approached your room i examined the window
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0038.wav,94604,no one less than that would have a chance
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0039.wav,156364,i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0040.wav,191564,he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0041.wav,255724,no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0042.wav,161964,a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0043.wav,66124,he put his shoes on the table
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0044.wav,92684,gloves said the young man
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0045.wav,116044,suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0046.wav,75244,have i told the truth mister gilchrist

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0048.wav,296524,it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0049.wav,242444,it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/1580-141084-0050.wav,89004,if mister soames saw them the game was up
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0000.wav,91724,she was tired of other things
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0001.wav,445164,she tried this morning an air or two upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philip's letter
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0002.wav,175404,well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0003.wav,320684,i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0004.wav,307564,i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0005.wav,148844,thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0006.wav,143084,is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0007.wav,473964,i have not asked him ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0008.wav,97324,mother i'm going to study medicine
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0009.wav,179244,margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0011.wav,107404,does thee think thee could stand it six months
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0012.wav,149804,and besides suppose thee does learn medicine

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0014.wav,104364,where thee and thy family are known

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0016.wav,222284,ruth sat quite still for a time with face intent and flushed it was out now
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0017.wav,125804,the sight seers returned in high spirits from the city
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0018.wav,388524,ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0019.wav,87244,and then there was broad street
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/4970-29095-0020.wav,395724,there certainly was no end to it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/237-126133-0025.wav,120204,at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0000.wav,386764,but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0001.wav,181644,the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0002.wav,339724,such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0003.wav,608844,with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0004.wav,170604,in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0005.wav,269004,under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0006.wav,464204,drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0007.wav,337484,it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0008.wav,303884,the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0009.wav,403404,with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0010.wav,416204,the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0011.wav,353004,the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0012.wav,102604,there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0013.wav,179564,this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0014.wav,360204,many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0015.wav,269964,so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0016.wav,452844,many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0017.wav,266764,the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0018.wav,250124,the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0019.wav,120204,but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0020.wav,449164,so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0021.wav,337804,whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5694-0022.wav,137484,the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0000.wav,154604,in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0001.wav,470924,the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0002.wav,249804,but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0003.wav,171404,in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0004.wav,339244,if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0005.wav,641004,the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0006.wav,239084,very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0007.wav,312204,there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0008.wav,219084,the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0009.wav,160844,each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0010.wav,149324,the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0011.wav,264364,it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0012.wav,472364,it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0013.wav,148524,consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0014.wav,337324,among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5695-0015.wav,254444,the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0000.wav,365324,under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0001.wav,535564,but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0002.wav,240364,other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0003.wav,803724,a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0004.wav,150444,the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0005.wav,416844,throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0006.wav,133164,as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0007.wav,304044,the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0008.wav,232364,but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0009.wav,283564,in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/3570-5696-0010.wav,242284,an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0000.wav,70124,you know captain lake
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0001.wav,82604,said lord chelford addressing me
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0002.wav,89004,he had his hand upon lake's shoulder
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0003.wav,112364,they are cousins you know we are all cousins
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0004.wav,235724,whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0005.wav,323884,but her greeting to captain lake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0006.wav,107244,at dinner lake was easy and amusing
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0007.wav,194124,i'm glad you like it says wylder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0008.wav,195884,i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0009.wav,316524,and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0010.wav,202764,i was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0011.wav,203404,whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0012.wav,688364,and wylder laughed too more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus dorothy only remarking
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0013.wav,227084,do you know lake oh i really can't tell but he'll soon tire of country life
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0014.wav,83724,he's not a man for country quarters
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0015.wav,132684,i had a horrid dream about him last night that
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0016.wav,97964,oh i know that's lorne brandon
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32865-0017.wav,174604,all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0000.wav,285484,it was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redman's farm
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0001.wav,117164,well she was better though she had had a bad night
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0002.wav,354764,so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0003.wav,299084,women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0004.wav,358764,but poor rachel lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0005.wav,195564,this transient spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0006.wav,383724,there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0007.wav,217484,rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0008.wav,94444,you have been so ill my poor rachel
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0009.wav,164364,ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0010.wav,248044,poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0011.wav,294764,she spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0012.wav,140204,thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0013.wav,367884,chelford had a note from mister wylder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued dorcas after a little pause
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0014.wav,269004,yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0015.wav,64364,yes said rachel
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0016.wav,325964,and the wan oracle having spoken she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0017.wav,466924,of mark wylder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0018.wav,238124,it is an antipathy an antipathy i cannot get over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but don't blame me
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0019.wav,203244,i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0020.wav,209484,and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0021.wav,130924,dorcas in her strange way was moved
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32879-0022.wav,133644,i like you still rachel i'm sure i'll always like you

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0000.wav,84684,miss lake declined the carriage to night
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0001.wav,111084,and he added something still less complimentary
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0002.wav,164044,but don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0003.wav,91724,in the meantime i had formed a new idea of her
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0004.wav,295244,by this time lord chelford and wylder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on my want of general ship
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0005.wav,146924,and he made a little dip of his cane towards brandon hall over his shoulder
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0006.wav,134924,yes so they said but that would i think have been worse
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0007.wav,131884,if a fellow's been a little bit wild he's beelzebub at once

/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0009.wav,424364,i don't know and can't say how you fine gentlemen define wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0010.wav,481004,well you know radie women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i'm sure from what bracton has said to me i know him intimately that dorcas likes him and i can't conceive why they are not married
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0011.wav,235884,their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last said
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0012.wav,264364,now that's impossible radie for i really don't think i once thought of him all this evening except just while we were talking
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0013.wav,317804,there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
/data/STT_data/librispeech/LibriSpeech/test-clean-wav/5683-32866-0014.wav,127084,don't insult me stanley by talking again as you did this morning
